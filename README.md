# PlayerHider

> Ever hated someone so much you just want to remove them in every way possible?

This mod removes players from the game, in every way possible. This includes:
- Rendering
- Chat messages with their name in it
- Tab list
- Scoreboard
- Nametags
- Any items with their name in it, their name will be replaced with "player"
- And probably any other way you can think of
